### A1. AVERNIAN TARPIT  

A vast tarpit several hundred feet across. The is hot enough to burn (1d6 fire damage) and it is constantly bubbling. Dangers include:

-   A large gas bubble explodes, spattering those within 10 feet with hot tar. **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw** or 1d6 fire damage.
-   Getting stuck in the tar. (It counts as difficult terrain and requires a **DC 14 Strength check** to pass safely or a **DC 18 Strength check** to escape once stuck. If stuck, the victim will slowly sink into the tar, becoming submerged 3d6 rounds later.)
-   Jets of flame spontaneously erupt from particularly strong outgassing.
-   The gas itself can be toxic, requiring a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, characters are affected as per a _confusion_ spell, rolling on the custom table below once per minute to determine their actions. At the end of each minute, they can attempt another saving throw.

There are several small outcroppings of rock and solid-ish land dotted throughout the tarpit. On one of these is a giant boulder of gold that gleams in the strange, reddish light of Avernus. (The boulder is actually pyrite; fool’s gold.)

### A2. OBELISK OF UBBALUX  
-   _Descent Into Avernus_, p. 98.

A set of **astral pistons** within the obelisk are intrinsic to Ubbalux’ prison. The pistons can only be accessed if Ubbalux is freed.

#### FREEING UBBALUX:

-   As described in _Descent Into Avernus_, Ubbalux has heard of the Mirror of Mephistar (Hex I1) and believes Mephistopheles can unravel the riddle.
-   Bel built the prison and could free him. Ubbalux can also point them towards Bel’s Forge (Hex H2). (If it seems reasonable, Ubbalux might still be under the impression that Bel is the Archduke of Hell.)
-   You can also solve Bel’s original “riddle” (see below).

#### INVESTIGATING THE STONES: 
Bel told Ubbalux that the secret to escaping the prison was hidden in the arcane runes etched across the standing stones. The trick is that crucial information is located on the outside of the stones, where Ubbalux can’t see it.

-   A **DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check** indicates that each of the outer standing stones is associated with one of the schools of magic.
-   A character who speaks Infernal or succeeds on a **DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check** will notice that each standing stone has a cartouche containing two syllables, one of which is either the first or second syllable of the associated school of magic in Infernal and the other appears to be a nonsense syllable.
-   A similar cartouche appear on the inside of the stone (where Ubbalux can see it, although you can also look across the circle and see them from outside) with a similar pairing of the first or second syllable of the associated school of magic in Infernal (whichever one isn’t on the outside) and a nonsense syllable.

#### SOLVING THE RIDDLE: 
Combining the two “nonsense” syllables on each stone forms a command word associated with that stone. You can intuit the correct order of the syllables by looking at the matched syllable from the school of magic. (So the syllable in the cartouche with the first syllable of the school of magic should be the first syllable of the command word and the second syllable should be the second.)

To release Ubbalux, you need to place your hand on each stone and speak the associated command word (suffering the effect described on pg. 98 of _Decent Into Avernus_). Once this has been done with all eight stones, the energy field drops: Ubbalux is freed and the central obelisk can be accessed.
