### E1. WEATHERSTONE KEEP  
-   _[Ruined Prospects](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/295212/DDAL0909-Ruined-Prospects?affiliate_id=81207)_

This outpost is occupied by abishai loyal to Tiamat, supported by a small force of legion devils (merregon).

#### The Lost Hellrider: 
Beneath Weatherstone Keep is an ancient, heretical Temple of Torm. After the defeat of the Zarielites during the Charge of the Hellriders, one of the fleeing Hellriders reached this Keep and, following the divine guidance of Torm, sought refuge in the temple. The Hellrider was placed into a state of suspended animation and remains there still, protected by Torm’s holy ground.

If the PCs awake the Hellrider, use _[Part 6D-L Questioning the Hellriders](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46059/roleplaying-games/remixing-avernus-part-6d-l-questioning-the-hellriders)_ to determine what he knows.

### E2. TENTACULAR MINE  
A huge, open pit surrounded by fields of reddish slag is ringed with colossal, writhing tentacles.

The pit is a mine for green Baatorian steel. The tentacles are the groping extremities of a carcinomatous baatorian buried here. Its squirming extremities pose a constant danger to the miners.

#### Baatorian Steel: 
Baatorian steel can only be mined on Avernus, and its supply is often limited due to the logistical difficulties created by the Blood War. A piercing or slashing weapon crafted from Baatorian steel deals +1 damage and has a +1 bonus to attack rolls. (This is not a magical enhancement and does not stack with magical bonuses.)

Green baatorian steel is even rarer. It has the same properties, but can also be more easily crafted into _swords of wounding_ (and so most green Baatorian steel blades are such).

#### Baatorian Dream Machine: 
In the depths of the mine there is a technomantic device, built on somewhat similar principles to Mad Maggie’s dream machine, which keeps the cancroid baatorian dormant in a slumbering dream. Its effective range is limited, however, which is why the tentacles are most active (and dangerous) at the surface.

The machine includes a **Nirvanan cogbox**. If the cogbox is removed (or the machine otherwise disabled), however, the baatorian will awake and rip the mine apart.

No changes from the published text.

### E4. TOWER OF URM  
-   _Descent Into Avernus_, p. 97

There is a 1 in 4 chance that the tower is present (check per day if the PCs camp out at the site).

If the tower is not present, the iron foundations should be considered a **Hidden** location unless the PCs are specifically traveling along the edge of the lake or on the island itself. Spotting the foundations from the shores of the lake requires a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Mordenkainen can provide a **Heartstone** or **Phlegethosian sand**. His asking price for either is 30 soul coins, unless the PCs have done him some form of great service (like saving his life from an assassin).

#### Assassination/Kidnapping: 
Why not both? The assembled devils include both those secretly plotting to assassinate Mordenkainen and those who will kidnap the PCs if that seems advantageous.

#### Tower Maps: 
Ideally, we would also like to prep maps of Mordenkainen’s tower. [_Dance of Deathless Frost_](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/293787/Dance-of-the-Deathless-Frost?affiliate_id=81207) includes some notes for potential features and security measures.
