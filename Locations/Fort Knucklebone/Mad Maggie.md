## Who is Mad Maggie?
While Zariel’s attention is focused on the Blood War, power-hungry warlords of the Avernian wastes cobble together heavily armed gangs and lead packs of infernal war machines in brutal combat, carving out vicious fiefdoms for themselves. Mad Maggie is one such warlord.

Mad Maggie is a [night hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16965-night-hag) with the demeanor of a kindly grandmother, but her warm smile masks a cruel cunning. In addition to her heartstone, the hag carries a black soul bag (see the “[Night Hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-h#NightHag "Night Hag")” entry in the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_ for more information on this magic items. The bag contains nine [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin), which Mad Maggie uses to power her infernal war machines.

Years ago, a thirst to experience the ultimate misery brought the night hag to the first layer of the Nine Hells. Followed to Avernus by scores of bloodthirsty redcaps, Maggie found pieces of a beautiful tapestry that chronicled the fall of Zariel. It recounted the angel’s descent into Avernus, her betrayal at the hands of the Hellriders, and her submission to Asmodeus, which led to her becoming an archdevil worthy to rule Avernus. Mad Maggie is obsessed with Zariel’s cataclysmic saga and scours the wastelands of Avernus for more such relics. In the crucible of the Avernian wastelands, Mad Maggie has risen to become a respected warlord.

## Maggie’s Goals

Driven by her lust for misery and her delight in the corruption of the valiant, Mad Maggie seeks to collect more artifacts tied to Zariel’s fall from grace. When she becomes aware of Lulu’s relationship to Zariel, the night hag tries to dig up Lulu’s lost memories, believing they might hold the most exquisite emotional records of Zariel’s descent. As the characters assist Maggie in this endeavor, they gain favor with — and leverage over — the hag.

## Maggie’s Offers

Maggie has the means to unlock the memories Lulu struggles to remember. Once the memories are retrieved, the characters learn the destination of the next step of their journey.

Maggie also can furnish the characters with one or more infernal war machines, which would make their trip across the wastelands more manageable. Additionally, if the characters have no means of creating provisions, Maggie can supply them with food and water as well. Maggie could also offer information about the dangers the characters might face in the wasteland, including other gangs, if the characters gain enough leverage and delight Maggie with their offerings.
