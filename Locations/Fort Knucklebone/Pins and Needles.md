#### Pins and Needles

Mad Maggie cut a deal with a pit fiend to secure the services of two shrewd but lazy [imps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16933-imp) named Pins and Needles. Mad Maggie treats them with such kindness that the imps can’t imagine wanting to work for anyone else. In Mad Maggie’s presence, the imps usually assume the forms of ravens that nest in her hair or perch on her shoulders.

When not loitering around Fort Knucklebone, Pins and Needles keep tabs on the Blood War and spy on Mad Maggie’s rivals. Unlike most devils, Pins and Needles aren’t gunning for promotions. They shun the infernal hierarchy and crinkle their noses in disgust when anyone tries to foist more responsibility onto them.

## The Imps’ Goals
As much as they love their lives at Fort Knucklebone, the imps have a problem. They foolishly played a prank on one of the madcaps, Wazzik. Now they fear that Wazzik and a small group of his irrational friends are plotting revenge. The imps don’t want to tell Maggie because she warned them not to pick on the madcaps, so they see the characters as a potential solution to their situation.

## Helping the Imps
As events play out in Fort Knucklebone, the characters notice that Pins and Needles lurk about at a distance, whispering to each other and staring at the characters. If confronted, the imps make a big deal of revealing a secret. Of course they lie, telling the characters that a madcap named Wazzik is planning to kill Lulu and urging them to take care of this threat first.

A successful **DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) check** reveals that the imps are lying. If called on the lie, the imps reveal the truth about why they want Wazzik dead. They tell the characters exactly when and where to find Wazzik alone, and they promise to put in a good word with Maggie if the characters kill the madcap.

The imps’ information is sound, and the characters can take care of the problem quickly and quietly. However, if anyone witnesses the murder, the characters might have to deal with consequences and complications. Fortunately for the characters, Maggie cares little for the madcaps and ignores the death, although it might lower the characters in her esteem a bit when it comes time to reward them.
