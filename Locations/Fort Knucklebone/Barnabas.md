#### Barnabas the Flameskull
![[Barnabas.png]]

Barnabas, once a powerful wizard, had his crypt defiled by an evil nemesis who stole his skull and turned it into a [flameskull](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17091-flameskull). Mad Maggie struck a bargain with this rival wizard and took Barnabas as payment. Now he’s a part of her gang.

Barnabas is forgetful and a bit pompous, but every now and then he has amazing ideas and remembers remarkably useful things from his arcane past.

**Barnabas’s Goal.** 
The redcaps like to hurl things at Barnabas, and after getting hit in the jaw with a loose gear, Barnabas lost one of his teeth. He saw a redcap, Grubba, grab it and run off. Barnabas is too embarrassed to tell Mad Maggie about it, though she suspects something is amiss because Barnabas has starting whistling when he speaks.

He quietly asks the characters to help him find his missing tooth. He points out Grubba the redcap but admits that all the little sly creatures look similar to him.

**Helping Barnabas.** 
Characters can question the redcaps, starting with Grubba, to find out who has the tooth. Each time they question a redcap, there is a 50 percent chance that the redcap gets angry and attacks the characters, backed up by 1d4 additional redcaps.

The redcaps believe the tooth is a lucky charm, so they frequently pass it from one to the next to keep Barnabas from finding it. Because of this constant transfer of the tooth, there’s little hope of the characters finding it by confronting one redcap at a time. However, a character who quietly observes the redcaps for 10 minutes can attempt a **DC 11 Wisdom** ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check. On a success, the character sees one redcap passing a bloody pouch to another redcap, who tucks it in a pocket. This pouch contains Barnabas’s tooth.

A character who moves within reach of the redcap can attempt to pick its pocket and obtain the pouch without its knowledge, doing so with a successful **DC 14 Dexterity** ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand)) check.

No redcap relinquishes the pouch willingly, though it can be magically [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) into doing so. The redcap attacks any character who tries to take it by force, and twelve other redcaps join the fight on the next round. Mad Maggie won’t break up such a fight unless the characters have done something nice for her, although if the dreamscape ritual has not taken place yet, she won’t allow the redcaps to kill a character.
