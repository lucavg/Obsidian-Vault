After leaving Elturel, the adventurers head to Fort Knucklebone, a junkyard stronghold on the edge of a desolate expanse of Avernus ravaged by rival gangs of scavengers. Fort Knucklebone doesn’t appear on the poster map of Avernus, as the map’s cartographer never found or visited this location.

Fort Knucklebone provides shelter to a gang of wasteland marauders called the Knucklebones, serving as a garage where they build and repair infernal war machines. The Knucklebones answer to Mad Maggie, a night hag warlord who has an agreement with Zariel: the archduke of Avernus leaves Fort Knucklebone alone as long as Mad Maggie keeps the other warlords in the area in check.

Lulu believes that the kenku from the visions reside in the fort and may be able to help, which is partially true. They can bring Lulu and the characters to Mad Maggie, who can in turn provide them with assistance.

## Entering the fort
The gatehouse serves as the entrance to Fort Knucklebone. Six [redcaps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2556141-redcap) stand guard atop it. One redcap yells down at the characters as they approach, asking for the password. After a few moments, a different redcap says, “We don’t have a password!” All the redcaps fall over in peals of mirth.

The redcaps on guard duty give the characters a difficult time, asking them to do ridiculous things to gain entrance. After a few minutes, when the characters get fed up with the nonsense, the redcaps tell them to quit standing around like idiots and come inside.

## Seeing the Kenku
**The area enclosed by the rampart is littered with trash and mechanical parts, some put together in a way that resembles a vehicle. Ramshackle structures, built from the same junk as the outer wall, provide shelter.**

**A platoon of small fey creatures mills about, all looking like feral gnomes. Several them sport tall red caps, some of which drip with vile ichor.**

**A pair of kenku examine one of the strange vehicles, chattering to each other in high-pitched squawks. These kenku carry an assortment of strange tools. When they see you, they turn and stare in wonder.**

**One of the kenku waves in your direction as if telling you to remain where you are. “What a deal! Patience is a virtue! Can’t keep the boss waiting!” He runs off into one of the trash structures.**

**Moments later he returns, leading a tall creature wearing a long, tattered shift covered in mud, blood, mold, and worse. The hag’s eyes seem to move independently of each other as she approaches, her straggly brown hair hanging in front of them. Resting on each shoulder are red-eyed ravens that scrutinize your group. Behind her, a hulking creature built of disparate fiendish parts trudges, moaning and hopping as it walks.**

**Then both of the hag’s eyes focus keenly on your group, and on Lulu specifically. “My goodness!” the hag croaks, spittle dribbling from her mouth. “Where did you find such a treasure?”**

The characters can explain their predicament, and Mad Maggie can offer to unlock Lulu’s memories, joyfully telling the characters about Lulu’s possible relationship to Zariel. Before she does that, however, Mad Maggie tells the characters she needs to gather supplies for the ritual of memory unlocking. This gives the characters a chance to interact with the other members of Mad Maggie’s gang and maybe earn some good will with them as mentioned under their individual descriptions below.
