Fort Knucklebones is a trading post; a sort of Port Royal for the Avernian warlords where they come for supplies, recreation, and repairs. This also makes it a useful hub of operations for the PCs.

Mad Maggie is the current potentate of the fort. Although not a warlord herself, she is seen by them as an equal and the neutrality of the fort is (generally) respected.

The fort itself, based around an outcropping or red rock shaped like a clawed hand, is somewhat described in _Descent Into Avernus_, p. 80:

-   There’s a **rampart** of rock, bones, and metal debris with a **gatehouse**.
-   The **outer court**, roughly the area that lies between the rampart and the knuckle gates.
-   There are four **courtyards** located between each of the knuckles. These courtyards are fronted by the **knuckle gates**, which can be shut for an additional line of defense, but are generally left open.
-   There is a **fastness** within the outcropping, with access caves from most of the knuckle courtyards. The fastness includes various storehouses and also Maggie’s demesne.

> _Note: Fort Knucklebones is also likely to be the PCs’ first introduction to soul coins as a form of currency. Take the opportunity to push home the “you’re not in Kansas any more” moment. Check out [Addendum: Soul Coins](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45049/roleplaying-games/remixing-avernus-addendum-soul-coins), for a more detailed look at how the coins can be used in Descent Into Avernus._

## Entering the fort
The gatehouse serves as the entrance to Fort Knucklebone. Six [redcaps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2556141-redcap) stand guard atop it. One redcap yells down at the characters as they approach, asking for the password. After a few moments, a different redcap says, “We don’t have a password!” All the redcaps fall over in peals of mirth.

The redcaps on guard duty give the characters a difficult time, asking them to do ridiculous things to gain entrance. After a few minutes, when the characters get fed up with the nonsense, the redcaps tell them to quit standing around like idiots and come inside.

## BETWEEN THE KNUCKLES: 
There are four courtyards located between the “knuckles” of the outcropping.

-   The **tinker’s shed**, a service station for war machines run by the kenku. A large cave at the back of this courtyard serves as a garage. The kenku live in a number of smaller caves that line the fingers to either side of the courtyard. A number of these caves are quite high, and the kenku have to climb ladders carved into the rock. (According to the flock’s oral tradition, before their entire species was cursed, the kenku of Fort Knucklebones could simply fly up to these caves. That’s how long they’ve been living here.)
-   **The Well**, a bar built up around a rare natural spring of clean water. This spring is the reason Fort Knucklebones has been so constantly occupied. The barkeep at the Well is named [[Natasha the Dark]]; she claims to be a “cloned daughter of Baba Yaga.” (This would imply that she’s the clone-sister of Iggwilv. She’s probably making it up. But who knows? Maybe _she’s_ the real Tasha who invented _Tasha’s hideous laughter_ and Iggwilv stole _her_)
-   The **arcade** is filled with market tents. Maggie’s infernal bank, run by an imp named [[Sarcasia]], can also be found here. (It houses her stockpile of soul coins, acts as a moneychanger, and offers loans of various sorts.)
-   The **hostel**, located in the broad space between thumb and index finger, is more of a public campground. No fees are charged. Anyone can grab a slab of space and pitch a tent. (Maggie figures that if people are staying here, they’ll be spending money at the arcade and that’s where she gets her cut.) The imps love to play practical jokes on people staying here.

> _Note: “Tinker’s shed” is the generic term on Avernus for war machine repair shops or service stations. They take the name “shed” because they’re usually rather small. The kenku’s facility here at Fort Knucklebones is expansive, but still referred to as a shed._

## Extracting the location of the sword
-   The PCs come to Fort Knucklebones.
-   The kenku explain that they can’t help, but maybe Mad Maggie can.
-   Mad Maggie is intrigued. She has a machine that she thinks could be used to recover Lulu’s lost memories.
-   Just one problem: The machine doesn’t work. It’s missing four key components. The PCs will need to find these components in order to make the machine work.

To find these components, the PCs will need to explore Avernus (as described in [Part 7](https://thealexandrian.net/?p=46140)). Once they have the components, the dream machine can be repaired and Lulu’s memories recovered (as described in [Part 6D-I](https://thealexandrian.net/?p=45859)).

### THE FOUR COMPONENTS:
-   **Nirvanan Cogbox**. Used in a variety of infernal machines, these cogboxes come from Mechanus. 
-   **Heartstone**. Used by night hags to infiltrate the dreams of their victims. It’s used as a prism or beam-splitter in the dream machine.
-   **Phlegethosian sand**. Obsidian sand pounded from the jagged, rocky plains of Phlegethos, the fourth layer of Hell.
-   **Astral pistons**. Another component used in various pieces of infernal machinery. The pistons are actually extruded into the astral plane, maximizing their mechanical output. It’s an outdated technology and rarely used these days.
### Location of the components
**Astral Pistons**: She’s heard that an oni named Malargan — the forgemaster of Kolasiah, a local warlord — has a set of astral pistons in his forge. (Hex A5)

**Astral Pistons**: Uldrak the Tinker, whose shop is based out of a titanic helmet located in the western end of the Plains of Fire, had a set of astral pistons in stock a few years back when one of Maggie’s riders (now dead) needed repairs for an antique war machine. It’s possible he might still have a supply. (Hex D5)

**Phlegethosian sand**: Mad Maggie and Red Ruth (Hex B4) were part of a coven along with a third night hag named Gaunt Gella. Mad Maggie believes that Red Ruth killed Gella and stole her heartstone. Maggie suspects that Red Ruth is still located somewhere in Avernus, but she doesn’t know where. However, she _has_ heard rumors that Red Ruth has been seen at Mahadi’s Emporium from time to time, and the PCs might check there for a lead to Red Ruth’s current location.

**Nirvanan Cogbox**: Nirvanan cogboxes are a modronic technomancy. Maggie has heard that a modron ship crashed on the shores of the Styx contra-Dis from Fort Knucklebones. (The ship is located in Hex H5, but it’s actually an elemental galleon from Eberron and does not have a cogbox.)
