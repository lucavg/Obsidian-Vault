## Who are Chukka and Clonk?
These two [kenku](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17165-kenku) are loyal, longtime associates of Mad Maggie’s. She refers to them as the Magpies/Eksters. Clonk, the bigger of the two kenku, is the strong, silent type who sometimes drives Mad Maggie’s infernal war machine. Chukka is animated, irritable, and takes care of repairs around the fort.

Chukka and Clonk lost their weapons and replaced them with the following weapons salvaged from infernal battlefields:
-   Chukka wields a silvered pike (+2 to hit) that has a reach of 10 feet and deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit.
-   Clonk wields a [hellfire warhammer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/843043-hellfire-warhammer) (+2 to hit) that deals 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage on a hit, or 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands. For more information on hellfire weapons, see "[Hellfire Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/magic-items#HellfireWeapon "Hellfire Weapon")".

## Chukka and Clonk’s Goal. 
The kenku live to build, fix, and drive infernal machines. At some point during their visit, the characters see the kenku angrily hammering on a nonfunctional [Demon Grinder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/demon-grinder). It isn’t working, and they can’t figure out why. They would be very grateful to anyone who could help them discern the problem.

## Helping the Kenku. 
One of the parts in the [Demon Grinder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/demon-grinder) — a spiky gear — is disrupting the flow of infernal energy through the vehicle. The gear, comprised of spikes from a hezrou demon, surges with demonic energy to cause the malfunction. A successful **DC 15 Intelligence** ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana) or [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) by a character who spends at least 10 minutes examining the vehicle reveals which part is to blame.

Chukka and Clonk appreciate the help in identifying the problem. Characters can further assist by finding a way to remove the demonic essence from the gear. Spells such as [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) or [protection from evil or good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good), or other methods that the characters might imagine, could make the part usable. If the characters help the pair get the infernal machine running, the kenku express their pleasure to Mad Maggie, who becomes even more likely to help the characters in their quest.
