# Summary:
A traveling bazaar winds its way across Avernus — a wandering menagerie of merchants, artisans, and misfits who ply their respective trades and sell their wares under the direction of [[Mahadi]], a rakshasa that claims Asmodeus as his patron.

Most merchants in the Wandering Emporium are indentured to [[Mahadi]]’s service until they pay off their soul debts. In many cases, the terms of repayment are vague enough to keep them in [[Mahadi]]’s employ for as long as he deems them necessary to the operation of the Wandering Emporium.

Mahadi is very serious about his contract between host and guest in the Wandering Emporium, and the only significant requirements for a guest are “No fighting, no spellcasting, and pay for services rendered.” The mere act of entering the Wandering Emporium signs a contract that there must be “no fuss,” which Mahadi holds for each guest, immediately canceled the moment they step outside the bounds of the establishment.
# Shops:
#### [[Infernal Rapture]]:
![[Mahadi.png]]
As the owner and host of Infernal Rapture, Mahadi takes his responsibilities very seriously. Every patron that enters the demiplane that houses his establishment must sign an infernal contract. It presents a very simple arrangement stipulating that patrons must pay for everything consumed and all services used before they leave.

Mahadi employs many servants, each of them under the effect of a [geas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas) spell to provide the best service they possibly can and appear happy while they work. Most of these individuals are former patrons.

Upon entry into Infernal Rapture, guests are escorted to a private chamber where they may lounge on pillows, cushions, and divans as they place orders for extravagant dishes from across the planes of existence and enjoy a variety of spa services that range from the simple and mundane to the exotic and bizarre.

Since Infernal Rapture exists in a demiplane, it doesn’t technically reside in the Nine Hells. If someone wanted to meet with creatures unable or unwilling to travel to the Nine Hells (or even just Avernus), this establishment provides a possible meeting location. Of course, entrance to the demiplane must be negotiated with Mahadi, with the promise of appropriate payment.

Each chamber that exists inside Infernal Rapture is created for a specific purpose. When that purpose ends and the occupants of the chamber leave, that room ceases to exist unless Mahadi deems otherwise.

**Dining Services.** The dining menu at Infernal Rapture changes daily, providing a fixed-price selection. Sample menus are provided as player handouts in [appendix E](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/infernal-rapture-menu "appendix E"). A full meal costs one [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin). Unlike food consumed elsewhere in Avernus, which is uniformly terrible, the food at Infernal Rapture tastes delicious.

Special food requests can be filled, but they must be made weeks in advance and can be costly. Mahadi charges from five to ten [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) for an exotic request, depending on the difficulty involved in fulfilling it. Consuming a meal at Infernal Rapture has the same benefits as a [heroes’ feast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/heroes-feast) spell, with the added effect that those who eat the food have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) checks made against Mahadi.

**Spa Services.** Infernal Rapture offers a variety of spa services. Light spa amenities (body, foot, and hand treatments, massage therapy, skin care, general grooming and bathing) are included along with the standard dining menu at no additional expense.

**Specialty services** include dream therapy, whole body restoration, and longevity therapy, as well as a host of services for every appetite, both wholesome and degenerate. Each of these services costs an additional [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin). Mahadi consistently and laboriously upsells further services to clients at additional expense. He seeks to take possession of such individuals and make them permanent residents of Avernus.


#### [[Firesnake Forge]]
![[Salamanders.png]]
This establishment is run by three [salamanders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17004-salamander) named Rassh, Skids, and Slagg. The salamanders owe Mahadi a debt for taking them in and secreting them away after a bold escape from [Bel’s Forge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/avernus-path-of-devils#BelsForge "Bel’s Forge"). They operate as indentured servants, maintaining Mahadi’s infernal war machines while also crafting wares for sale to visitors. From time to time, Mahadi sends them abroad to procure parts to refurbish the caravan. Nine [magmins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16949-magmin) and eight suits of [animated armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16786-animated-armor) assist the salamanders with their work.

The salamanders’ infernal war machine has been cobbled together from a half dozen others. At a moment’s notice, the vehicle can separate into three smaller infernal war machines, each piloted by one of the salamanders. Treat these smaller vehicles as [Tormentors](https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/tormentor).

**Weapons and Armor.** All metal armor and weapons listed in [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment "chapter 5") of the _[Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook")_ are available for sale at this shop, at a 150 percent markup.

**Infernal War Machine Repair.** The salamanders can repair a damaged but functional infernal war machine at a cost of 50 gp per hit point restored.

#### Brenda the Barber
![[Brenda.png]]
Brenda appears as a cheerful, well-kept Calishite woman. She provides all services any proficient barber might, up to and including medical attention for those with injuries or ailments. For healing purposes, treat Brenda as though she has the [Healer feat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/healer "Healer feat") as well as proficiency with both the [healer’s kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/healers-kit) and the [herbalism kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/herbalism-kit).

While she works, Brenda tells all manner of stories, making them up as she goes along, but always with a moral at the end. Brenda’s stories might point toward an achievable objective, if the customer is of good alignment and inclined to take direction from the chatty barber.

Brenda is, in fact, an [ancient copper dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16779-ancient-copper-dragon) named Balarystul. Brenda resides in Avernus on direct assignment from Bahamut, keeping an eye out for signs of increased activity among Tiamat’s followers. After the last time the queen of evil dragons tried to escape the Nine Hells, those who oppose her are taking no chances. Brenda is particularly interested in any information about the activities of [Arkhan the Cruel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/416910-arkhan-the-cruel) (see "[Arkhan the Cruel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/avernus-path-of-devils#ArkhantheCruel "Arkhan the Cruel")").

Brenda has received several blessings in her service to Bahamut:

-   Unless Brenda decided otherwise, once any creature less powerful than a deity has taken three steps from her, they can no longer remember her or having interacted with her specifically.
-   Brenda is under the effect of a permanent [mind blank](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mind-blank) spell, and cannot be detected by magical or mundane means unless she wishes it. In exchange for this blessing, Brenda can take no direct action against the denizens of the Nine Hells, though she can certainly enlist the help of those who can.
-   Brenda always knows the location of the Wandering Emporium and can transport herself there as though by a [word of recall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/word-of-recall) spell. This explains why Brenda simply seems to appear amid the fully deployed marketplace each morning it is active to provide service and tell stories.
-   Once each day, when Brenda so desires, she can instantly transport herself to the court of Bahamut via a powerful blessing akin to the [plane shift](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift) spell.

**Barber Pricing.** Brenda charges 1 gp for each service involving grooming. Brenda can provide some small amount of magic healing, but only does so for good-aligned creatures, and at no cost.

If someone offers Brenda a [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) for any reason, she looks extremely disappointed and turns it down. She refuses even to touch one.

#### [[From Here to Avernus]]
![[Fhet'Ahla.png]]
Fhet’Ahla, an [amnizu](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/94669-amnizu), provides [imps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16933-imp) as couriers as well as a variety of spellcasting services for transmitting information over long distances. The more secure the means, however, the more expensive the service. Additionally, Fhet’Ahla acts as an exchange for [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin), offering 100 gp in coins or gemstones for each [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) delivered, and can serve as an official notary for the signing of infernal contracts.

Fhet’Ahla failed a critical mission at some point in the past and gained the disfavor of Asmodeus. As a punishment, Asmodeus posted him with Mahadi. While Fhet’Ahla doesn’t owe Mahadi any kind of debt, he is on the wrong side of Asmodeus and has no idea how many centuries this service will last. The amnizu is also forbidden from challenging Mahadi’s authority in all matters pertaining to the operation of the Wandering Emporium or any other special assignments the rakshasa receives from Asmodeus.

**Delivery Pricing.** Fhet’Ahla charges a single [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) for parcel deliveries weighing 5 pounds or less. For a larger parcel (up to 50 pounds), he charges two [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin).

**Notary Pricing.** Fhet’Ahla charges a single [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) for notary services and collects a single [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) for exchanges that don’t involve the soul of a celestial. If a celestial is involved, he collects ten [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin).

#### [[Ichor’s Aweigh!]]

Elliach, a lawful evil human [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16947-mage), collects and sells flasks of [demon ichor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/avernus#DemonIchor "demon ichor"). Exposure to demon ichor has warped Elliach in the following ways:

-   Elliach’s arms have become tentacles with fingers at the ends, increasing his reach by 5 feet.
-   Elliach’s ears sprouted wings and flew away. Consequently, he is deaf. He relies on lip-reading and hand gestures.
![[Elliach.png]]
Elliach met Mahadi while on the run from debt collectors. Mahadi saw the value in paying off Elliach’s debts and bringing him to Avernus to work in the Wandering Emporium. Thought to be insane by many of the other vendors, Elliach uses demon ichor in a host of magical experiments, none of which seem to have the intended results.

**Demon Ichor Prices.** Elliach sells demon ichor for 50 gp a flask and buys demon ichor for 25 gp a flask.

#### Z’neth’s Larva Farm

Z’neth is a bitter, old [hobgoblin warlord](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17161-hobgoblin-warlord) who buys and sells [larvae](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/27752-larva) (see [chapter 2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Hades "chapter 2") of the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_ for statistics). 
![[Z'neth.png]]

Mahadi facilitated Z’neth’s rise to power, helping him destroy entire kingdoms on the Material Plane. Z’neth’s conquests eventually caught the eye of the mighty god Maglubiyet, who offered Z’neth a command on the battlefields of Gehenna. Before he could wrack up his first victory on that plane, however, Mahadi collected on Z’neth’s debt and bore him away to Avernus, where he languishes in obscurity, far from the planar battlefield he had hoped to die on.

Z’neth procures larvae from yugoloths and sells them at marked-up prices to hags and other interested buyers, giving half his proceeds to Mahadi in exchange for food and other necessities. Z’neth’s wares are of little interest to adventurers. However, Z’neth is fond of using his profits to hire assassins to kill Mahadi, which the rakshasa finds endlessly amusing.

If the characters pay his establishment a visit, Z’neth offers them nine [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) (all he has) for Mahadi’s head. A [geas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/geas) spell prevents the hobgoblin from divulging Mahadi’s true form. Mahadi greets Z’neth’s would-be assassins with a smile and is more than happy to accept Z’neth’s [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) as payment for goods and services at his fine restaurant.

Larvae. At any given time, Z’neth has 2d6 [larvae](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/27752-larva) trapped in cages. He charges one [soul coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) per larva.

#### [[Blophog’s Wondrous Things]]

[[Blophog]] is a bearded devil with only one chin tentacle. He sells an abundance of wonderful things that are thoroughly suspect.
![[Blophog.png]]

#### The Distinguished Traveler

[Tavokiin](https://dgbg.obsidianportal.com/characters/tavokiin), an older, tired githyanki knight, runs a shop in which there are various supplies needed for travel. Rope, tents, climbing gear, tinker’s tools, etc. are available here, although there are no travel rations (“Visit the Infernal Rapture. They can pack you a delightful picnic meal at your convenience!”)
![[Tavokiin.png]]

#### [[The Rose Repose]]
Store type: Jeweler, Perfumist, Florist, Necromancer

-   Shop owner: Vroscaz the lich
![[Vroscaz.png]]

-   Notable crew: Ibnar, undead mind flayer who Vroscaz rescued from its Elder Brain, skeletons with soul coins embedded into foreheads (the souls within have the choice of serving as employees, or risk being lost forever to infernal commerce). All crew wear flower crowns as their uniform.
![[Ibnar.png]]

-   Why use this shop?: If you have a spellcaster who might want a unique arcane focus, someone who enjoys beauty/finery, a means of upgrading the skeletons from the Dungeon of the Dead Three if they're still around, or as a means of information gathering via the flock of incubi and succubi out front.


The Rose Repose, a shop embedded in the side of a warmachine with a wrought iron balcony out front, manages to stand out amongst the crowd of merchant stalls with a beautiful floral garden, crystal displays featuring jewels from across the planes, and the heavy scent of multiple types of perfume mixing together. Atop the wrought iron perches in front of the store rests a small flock of incubi and succubi wearing brightly-coloured silk robes, gossiping and taking sips from small vials of perfume. Looking inside the shop, skeletons with iron coins embedded in their skulls dutifully stock shelves while wearing flower crowns.

#### [[Gabool's Pitchfork Emporium]]
-   **Shop owner:** Vroscaz the lich
-  **Store type:** Weapons
-  **Shop owner:** Gabool, a spined devil with prominent pitchfork-like horns
![[Gabool.png]]

-  **Notable crew:** Gabool's "Brother" Argrel the barbed devil, cursed with a scrunched-up face and especially short legs. He repeats Gabool's pitchfork-related exclamations and helps with upkeep of the weapon stand.

-  **Why use this shop?:** Many devils and yugoloths use pitchforks as their favoured weapons - it makes sense that they are in demand. It could also provide warmachines equipped with harpoon flingers some unique ammunition, at your discretion.

A pitchfork (trident) costs 1 soul coin, and can have modifications purchased from the below table. A custom pitchfork costs 2 soul coins, and comes with three modifications (which each mustcome from the 1 soul range). A pitchfork can have up to four modifications. Pitchforks are not considered magic weapons unless specified by a modification.

#### [[Sister Elga's House of Curses]]
-   Store type: Magic Services

-   Shop owner: Sister Elga, a green hag aspiring to become a night hag.
![[Sister Elga.png]]

-   Notable crew: A long-nosed gargoyle who watches the hut's door, a huge vulture who stands on the roof, and some kind of long-armed creature who performs tasks such as cleaning and inventory by reaching its long arms through tiny trapdoors around the shop.

-   Why use this shop?: Removing mutations caused by demon ichor requires a remove curse spell. If the party has nobody who can cast this spell, this shop can provide a means of recovering from these effects. In addition, if players find themselves with bitter rivals, they can ask the hag to place curses on them to get an edge.

A curse can be purchased in one of the following ways: as a one-time use poison (such as a dying toad who's last burp is poison gas, a vial of glowing blood to coat a weapon with for one strike, or toenail clippings which vanish into any meal they are sprinkled into without a trace), or by using a piece of the intended target. A poison requires a DC 15 Constitution save to avoid, while a curse cast through a piece of the target takes effect instantly. Any curse described here can be removed with a remove curse spell or similar effect.

Besides listed prices, hags appreciate the morbid, the hideous, the weird, and above all, suffering. Seeing one of the characters or an innocent creature suffer at their own hands causes the hag delight enough to give services discounted or even free.
