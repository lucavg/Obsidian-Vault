[[Mahadi]] the rakshasa appears as a wealthy merchant lord. Though extremely powerful, Mahadi doesn’t believe in taking unnecessary risks, particularly in the Nine Hells where he can be permanently slain. Mahadi acts as the eyes and ears of Asmodeus in Avernus. As a deal broker and moderator, he’s privy to all manner of dealings that might otherwise escape the attention of his patron.

In his role as the master of the [[Wandering Emporium]], Mahadi has received special dispensation from [[Asmodeus]] to travel freely between the Material Plane and the Nine Hells to operate his business, as well as to pursue information and broker contracts and other such arrangements as needed.

In addition to managing the Wandering Emporium, Mahadi is also the proprietor and host of Infernal Rapture, a restaurant and spa. Since the establishment exists within a demiplane, patrons can comfortably visit it at any time, even while the caravan is on the move. As long as they can pay for services rendered, guests need not fear being trapped within, since Mahadi is very serious about maintaining the contract between host and guest. Each guest must agree to this formal arrangement prior to gaining entrance.

Mahadi has a special collection of named soul coins, each of which harbors the soul of an enemy the rakshasa vanquished in the past. Mahadi consults with these souls individually, forcing them to provide insight on all manner of subjects.

If adventurers inform Mahadi (and by extension [[Asmodeus]]) about [[Arkhan]]’s possession of the [Hand of Vecna](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/11114-hand-of-vecna), Mahadi does everything he can to strike a deal with them, offering any of the gifts listed under “[[Mahadi’s Deals]]” in exchange for the artifact. This is in lieu of the terms normally offered by Asmodeus.
