#### Mahadi’s Deals

Mahadi has the power to make deals at the direction and with the authority of Asmodeus as if he were an archdevil. All such deals must be presented to the other party without alteration, and they are not negotiable. In all such agreements, Asmodeus wants one thing only: a character signing one of these contracts gives up their soul forever. 

After the signing character reaches 17th level, if at any point they die, their death is permanent, with no chance to return from the grave. Asmodeus takes their soul and makes them a [pit fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16979-pit-fiend), in his service for eternity.

Mahadi can offer the following gifts in exchange for a soul contract:

**Magic Item.** Asmodeus gifts the adventurer with a [rod of lordly might](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4746-rod-of-lordly-might), to which only the recipient and its direct descendants can attune.

**Resurrection.** Asmodeus sends one of his loyal priest followers to cast [true resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/true-resurrection) on a deceased character.

**Tiefling Transformation.** Asmodeus transforms the character into a [tiefling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/tiefling "tiefling") with a direct infernal bloodline to him. Substitute the character’s racial traits with [tiefling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/tiefling "tiefling") racial traits.
