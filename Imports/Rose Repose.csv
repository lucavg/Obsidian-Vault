Item,Price,Description
Polished Amber,1s/dozen; 10 GP ea,"Clear, polished amber in a droplet shape"
Blood Diamonds,1-10s,"Clear diamonds clouded with blood. Quality varies. For use as a spell component, consider each soul coin to be 100 gp in worth."
Amber (with inclusions),2s,"Rough amber with a small, long-dead creature trapped inside. When added to a spell focus, spells that deal necrotic damage instead heal targeted undead creatures the same amount."
Bloodstone,2s,"A rough, opaque, deep red crystal with flecks of dull iron lining its jagged edges. When added to a spell focus, spells of the necromancy school have their range increased by 20 feet if their range wasn't self or touch."
Stygian Crystal,2s,"A pale green, cloudy gem that looks as if it gained its colouration by a melted soul contained within. When added to a spell focus, the caster can impose disadvantage on the saving throw for one of the following spells once per day: confusion, enemies abound, feeblemind, or modify memory. It glows faintly when within 100 feet of the river styx."
Eternal Ice,2s,"Harvested from the wastes of Cania, this unmelting ice is so cold that it is surrounded by a slight fog. When added to a spell focus, creatures hit by your spell attacks which deal cold damage- as well as creatures who fail saving throws against your spells that deal cold damage- suffer a -10 penalty to movement until the start of your next turn."
Nessus Ruby,4s,"This ruby gleams like the eye of a predator. When added to a spell focus, creatures that fail on their saving throws against your enchantment spells are unaware a spell was placed on them, even if the spell says they learn of the spell later. However, creatures that succeed on the saving throw know of your attempt immediately."
Elemental Gem,4s,"Described in the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 167-168. Reccomended: Half-off price for the fire elemental gem, considering it is circumstantially much less useful than normal."

The soul coin can be used as normal while touching it."
